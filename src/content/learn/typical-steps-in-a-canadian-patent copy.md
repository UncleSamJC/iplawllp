## Preparing and Filing Your Patent Application in Canada
The first step in protecting your invention is preparing and filing a patent application with the **Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO)**. A complete application typically contains:

- **A detailed description** of the invention, including how it works and how it can be made or used.  
- **Claims**, which define the scope of the legal protection sought.  
- **Drawings** (where applicable), to illustrate the invention.  
- **An abstract**, summarizing the key features of the invention.  
- **Forms and fees** required by CIPO.  

Once submitted, CIPO issues an **official filing certificate** within a few weeks. This certificate confirms your filing date and establishes your priority in Canada. After receiving this proof of filing, you may legally mark your product as **‚Äúpatent pending‚Äù** when demonstrating, marketing, or selling it.

üëâ *Tip*: Filing early is important, as Canada generally follows a **‚Äúfirst-to-file‚Äù system**, meaning the first applicant to file a patent for an invention is entitled to the rights.

## Requesting Examination of Your Canadian Patent Application
Filing a patent application alone does **not** initiate examination. You must submit a **request for examination** within **four years** of the filing date. If you do not request examination within this period, your application will be considered abandoned.

The ability to defer examination gives applicants flexibility. You can:  
- **Evaluate market potential** before committing further costs.  
- **Wait for examination results in other jurisdictions** (such as the U.S. or Europe) and adjust your Canadian application accordingly.  
- **Leverage the Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH)** program, which allows for **accelerated examination** in Canada if your invention has been allowed in a partner country.  

Without acceleration, it may take **up to two years** (or longer) for CIPO to assign an examiner once the request is filed.

## Examination of Your Canadian Patent Application
During examination, a patent examiner reviews your application to ensure it meets the **requirements of the Canadian Patent Act**, including:

- **Novelty**: The invention must be new.  
- **Non-obviousness (inventive step)**: The invention must not be obvious to a person skilled in the art.  
- **Utility**: The invention must have practical application.  
- **Formal requirements**: Proper format, clarity, and support in the description.  

The examiner may issue:  
- A **Notice of Allowance** ‚Äì meaning your application is approved and ready for grant, or  
- An **Examiner‚Äôs Report (Office Action)** ‚Äì listing objections or rejections (e.g., lack of novelty, overly broad claims, or insufficient description).  

Most Canadian applications receive at least one examiner‚Äôs report. You (or your patent agent) must respond within the deadline (usually **six months**) by:  
- Amending claims,  
- Providing clarifications, and/or  
- Arguing against the examiner‚Äôs objections.  

If the examiner remains unsatisfied, further reports may follow until all issues are resolved or the application is abandoned.

## Allowance of Your Patent Application and Issuance of Your Granted Canadian Patent
Once all objections are resolved, the examiner will issue a **Notice of Allowance**. To complete the process, you must pay the **final fee** within a set deadline. Upon payment, your patent will be granted, and you will receive a **Canadian patent certificate**.

A granted Canadian patent provides the patent owner with the **exclusive right to make, use, and sell the invention in Canada** for a term of **20 years from the filing date**, subject to the payment of annual maintenance fees.

üëâ *Tip*: Even after grant, maintaining your patent requires **annual maintenance fees**, and failure to pay them may result in patent lapse.
